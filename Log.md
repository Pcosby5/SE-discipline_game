# Day 1: Introduction to Strings

Strings are a fundamental data type in programming languages, including but not limited to Python, Java, C++, and many others. In essence, a string is a sequence of characters, where each character can be a letter, digit, whitespace, or special symbol.

## 1. Definition
A string is typically enclosed in either single quotes (`' '`) or double quotes (`" "`). For example:
- `"Hello, World!"`
- `'12345'`
- `'This is a string'`

## 2. Immutability
In many programming languages, strings are immutable, meaning once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed. Any operation that seems to modify a string actually creates a new string with the modified content.

## 3. Operations on Strings
- Concatenation: Combining two or more strings together.
- Substring: Extracting a portion of a string.
- Length: Determining the length (number of characters) of a string.
- Comparison: Comparing two strings to check if they are equal, or if one comes before or after the other in lexicographical order.

## 4. Common String Methods
- `str.length()` (or `len(str)` in Python): Returns the length of the string.
- `str.concat(otherStr)` (or simply using `+` operator): Concatenates two strings.
- `str.substring(start, end)`: Extracts a substring from the original string.
- `str.charAt(index)` (or `str[index]` in Python): Returns the character at the specified index.

## 5. String Manipulation
- Upper/Lower Case Conversion: Changing the case of characters in a string.
- Trimming: Removing leading and trailing whitespace from a string.
- Splitting: Dividing a string into substrings based on a delimiter.
- Replacing: Replacing occurrences of a particular substring within a string with another substring.

## 6. String Literals and Escape Sequences
Strings may contain special characters that cannot be typed directly, such as newline `\n`, tab `\t`, or backslash `\\`. These are represented using escape sequences.

## 7. String Formatting
Combining strings with other data types or formatting them in a specific way, such as using placeholders or format specifiers.

As we progress further, we'll dive deeper into each aspect of strings, exploring advanced topics and practical applications.
